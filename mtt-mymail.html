myMail is an attractive email app and has 100,000+ downloads from the Play Store. Last week I installed the app to try it out, but ended up uninstalling it for whatever reason, and promptly forgot about it. But over the past few days, I've been frustrated because my new emails have been getting marked as read even before I open them. I asked the Exchange admin at work, and he found POP polling on my account from 185.30.176.94, which reverses to rpop2.my.com. That's a server belonging to myMail. Sorry!

Starting on October 12, students can sign up to switch their email to the Exchange server and use Outlook or just a web browser. Office 365 is free for students, so ITaP will be recommending that. All emails will be transferred, but students must switch by mid-January. This switch is set to save the university hundreds of thousands of dollars and eliminate many problems. Hello, Looking for an email client app I can set to only send work email alerts during work office hours. Do not Disturb won't work since I don't want to silence everything. I had to have my password reset for my school multiple times because I was using that app. They had been trying to figure out what the problem was, and told me this morning that they narrowed it down to the myMail app for andriod.

Hi, is there a "lookalike" iOS mail app for Android? I have been using one in years ago, but do not remember the name of the app. I know about gmail, outlook and the other apps. I'm really interested in a similar app like the native one. Thanks. I have the Purdue mail account set up on my phone, but I wanted to add the account to my Gmail, since there's an option to add another email account. I'm having difficult setting it up, with the outgoing server properties. Anyone know how to set up the account and properties. A year back or so I made an password protected Rar archive of some former projects of mine. You guessed it! I've lost the password to that archive. I'm sure I'd written it down somewhere. Last few days I've been guessing and checking off countless attempts. But than it hit me. I've created that archive on this machine. even winrar hasn't been updated since. I remember that someone told me once that Winrar stores the password(s) used to create (and/or open) archives on the hostmachine's. A couple days ago I posted about myMail storing my email password on their servers and continuing to POP my mail even after I uninstalled. Here's the original post. ( Today they sent a response: gt Hi dvanders, gt gt Thank you very much for your feedback. gt gt We really do temporarily cache users’ data on our server, as it’s the only gt way to provide myMail’s users with all those additi. I graduated last August, but still use my @purdue.edu email. I tried migrating everything over to 365 or whatever, but when i log in it just says 'this is where your apps should be. contact your administrator to add' or something like that. I'm assuming its because, now that I graduated, I get harassed for money instead of given access to things. I'd really like to keep using my account, since it makes me still feel like a student and being an adult really sucks. Am I out of luck or is there. 
Ever since I got this app I've been in love with the xylophone notification sound? I tried looking around the sys folders for it. I even tried saving the app on the desktop and making it a zip to browse the content. However, I've had no luck. I also tried looking on ringtone websites for it. So, does anyone know how to subtract the xylophone notification sound from the myMail app? Or where to get it from? I would really love to have this sound as my default notification sound for everything.

Hi all, I am trying to get a Macro for Outlook that will take a FedEx tracking number and change it to a hyperlink that shows the result of the tracking number. All of our tracking numbers will be the same length and start with the same few numbers (1111111 for example) and be the same length of 15 digits. I tried using a number wildcard of carrot # like 1111111^#^#^#^#^#^#^#^# to find the number. The FedEx tracking link is easy enough: https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/?tracknumbers= FIXED So for some weird reason, I am unable to log into MyMail. My password is still valid for a month, and I am able to log into MyPurdue without any problems. Anyone having similar issues? Who should I contact regarding this? EDIT: iTap suggested some fixes like resetting my password. Turns out that it was probably a password match issue, a password change fixed. </p>
