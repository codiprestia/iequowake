The latest Tweets from Jean Noir (@JeanNoir): "I love you @Grimezsz but can we PLEASE stop talking about your song "Go"??". I'm currently reading Reiss' The Black Count , which is about Alexandre Dumas pere 's father during the years after the Revolution. In it the author talks about the sugar plantation colony of Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti). It goes through a few of the court cases (from the parlement) where slavery wasn't exactly outlawed, but where it left slaves the ability to gain their freedom (the Edict states that if one were to marry in France then one's slavery is voided, which is an incredible.

When asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, George Mallory famously answered "Because it's there.". Same thing, except replacing Mallory with me and Mount Everest with Mount TBR.

BACK STORY: My whole life I was never into cologne and thought down on it because I thought people who needed cologne were just using it as a cover up for smelling bad and not cleaning themselves correctly but the beginning of 2018 my new girlfriend is really into perfume and she told me I need a scent to add even more character as it's little things that matter a lot. I shrugged it off, coincidentally a few weeks later I got a job offer at a new cologne store. Hi again MUE!

My personal overall collection and thoughts: TF Noir De Noir: Absolute favorite! Rose, oud, truffle and patchouli are some of the main notes and I am blown away. Longevity and silliage is amazing. Jpg ultra male: tied for second favorite with versace eros. An amazing sweet yet masculine fragrance. Longevity and sillage is great. Versace eros: a great sweet fragrance with a nice blend of vannila and apple. Longevity and silliage is great. Versace the dreamer: the second fragrance added Sorry if I should have posted it in recommendations sticky thread, it's a bit longer and not a typical recommendation request so I thought a separate post would do better. amp#x200B; Hello. I'm new to fragrances. 'New' isn't even accurate - having spent probably half of my 25 year life with a clogged allergic nose and never paying much attention to fragrances, I'd say I'm pretty damn olfactorically challenged. I decided to order a lot of samples online and was wondering whether you could. I saw recently a few good vagabondish books recommended, and I thought I'd add my favourites to the pile. - Isabelle Eberhardt; she was an absolute badass who wrote a few fiction and non fiction books. Crazy life, very random and to the winds, and I guarantee you will like her books. - Vagabonding , by Rolf Potts - some might classify this as lame, or ridiculous (it's kind of written as a "guide" to vagabonding) - but before I set out, as a teenager just raring to go. it was super exciting. Continuously updated! Some of these are samples that I just didn't like enough to keep and some of them are from full bottles that I've purchased--I get frustrated when the only way to sample a fragrance is by buying a  3ml decant on eBay, so I thought I'd make some samples on demand for people who happen to be looking for fragrances that I happen to own. All samples are  each .

My collection has gotten pretty large so I'm not sure when I'll finish another full bottle of anything. A few others I know I'd repurchase if I use them would be: Kerosene Fields of Rubus Prices Include Shipping in CONUS, PayPal friends and family, otherwise add 3.5%. Message me for pictures.

My husband‚Äôs birth country doesn‚Äôt have middle names, so people often have multiple first names.
