                            <p>In this session we will have an introductory look at animating objects with the Mecanim animation tool and state machine. Many people feel that Mecanim is meant exclusively for animating humanoid bi-ped characters, but it can be used for so much more - and not only character animation, but animating UI Elements, opening doors, changing lights. any publicly exposed value. Unity’s animation system comes with a lot of concepts and terminology. If at any point, you need to find out what something means, go to our Animation Glossary. Legacy animation system. While Mecanim is recommended for use in most situations, Unity has retained its legacy animation system which existed before Unity. Mecanim was the name of the animation software that we integrated into Unity. Early in the 4.x series of Unity, its abilities were tied specifically to humanoid character animation and it had many features which were uniquely suited for that purpose, and it was separate to our old (now legacy) integrated animation system. 
This post explains the technology behind Mecanim Humanoids. How it works, strengths and limitations, why some choices were made and hopefully some hints on how to get the best out of it.

Language. Welcome to Animating Characters with Mecanim in Unity 3D. We'll start by importing a few characters that were built in 3DS Max, and then map their basic bone and muscle structure so they can be animated using clips from multiple sources.  
Mecanim needs an overhaul. Since I primarily use Playmaker (which is already a state machine), there isn't a single advantage Mecanim gives me over the legacy system, and it introduces quite a few cons. Originally I decided to dabble in Mecanim because of the potential of using body masks in override layers. I have a fairly simple scene with a rigged character that is able to walk, run, jump, spin around etc. I am having a problem setting the proper settings for the animations in the Prefab FBX so that the character doesn't walk or run in place and the animations seamlessly blend properly. In particular - Loop Time - Loop Pose - Cycle Offset - Additive Reference Pose - Pose Frame and lastly - Root Motion Node Does anyone know of a good Mecanim example with a humanoid. /gt Guy (with IK script settings hand targets, and torso/head to look where camera looks) amp#x200B; //gtgt Rig amp#x200B; //gtgt Object Area (scripted to be at "Obj Transform") amp#x200B; ///gtgtgt Gun (scripted that "transform.forward = camera.forward") amp#x200B; ////gtgtgtgt Left and Right Hand Targets amp#x200B; /gt Camera (scripted to be at the rig's head position) amp#x200B; //gtgt Obj Transform amp#x200B; amp#x200B; Having. I'm trying to create a character controller similar to Zelda Breath of the Wild. I'm using the Kinematic Character Controller which works great and gives me full control over how the controller moves. amp#x200B; For basic movement I am using an animation that blends between idle, walking and running, moving the character forward. When moving the character is always walking forward. The character will walk forward away from the camera when pressing w, will turn right or left of the camera. I noticed this feature seems lacking in Mechanim. Changing the blend interpolation in both regular blends between two simple animations as well as in Blend Trees. Everything is linear and that is not always wanted, especially with character animations. Anyone know if there are any plans of adding different interpolation modes to Mechanim? Read this thread to further understand my request. https://answers.unity.com/questions/744470/changing-mechanims-blendtree-interpolation.html. 
I have an animation of a biped dancing which doesn't work very well with the character I want to put it on. Mainly the issue is their arms intersect their body. I can adjust the muscle settings in the avatar rigging screen to limit the movement of their arms so they can't do this, but these settings don't appear to be respected at all by the animation timeline even though it appears to be using the muscle controllers to control the animation. As there are hundreds of keyframes, I don't Currently I deactivate the animator component to achieve the ragdoll effect and turn it back on to get the character to animate again. The problem is when I reactivate the animator component the character flashes back to current animation played by the animator. It happens in one frame instead of slowly animating back in form. Is there a way to transition from a ragdoll back to a mecanim animation in a smooth. Hi The client has thrown me a loop. What has happened is that the final animation assets do not match the proxy assets. Instead of a single Idle state they now have given me three Idle states and I need to randomly choose the Idle animation state. So I am wondering if the attached Mecanim state diagram is possible? Is there some way thru code of deciding which particular animation state to branch to? https://imgur.com/a/hhQZE3o. 
I'm trying to create a simple 3 combo system. It should basically work in a way so that as long as the player keeps pressing the mousebutton while an attack animation is playing the player keeps doing different attacks. amp#x200B; The gif here (https://gyazo.com/80a32893452d61e53ff21b7890e54e01) shows how it should work. The gif here (https://gyazo.com/74bf991e4eddd872d90c7d4c1d2fe2a7) shows what goes wrong (I'm pressing the button to attack during the whole duration of the clip). I'm trying to set a player model to ragdoll when I activate a specific animation. This is due to the game not liking ragdoll scripts attached to players. Can this script be adapted as a state machine? using UnityEngine; using System.Collections; public class Ragdollcontroller : MonoBehaviour { public Component bones; public Animator anim; public bool isDead; // Use this for initialization void Start() { bones = gameObject.GetComponentsI. I want to import a new animation I made in Blender, but it comes attached with everything else. I've looked up tutorials and they advise to select Mesh and Armature only, but this still doesn't give the expected result. IE: I don't want to rebuild my scene each time I add a new animation. Can't I import an animation, move it into my assets, then add it to other models Animancer Lite is Free (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/animancer-lite-116516) and Animancer Pro costs  (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/animancer-pro-116514). I've just released a fairly minor update to my Animancer plugin and I put a lot of work into improving the store page and user manual so I'd like to get your feedback in two main areas: 1. If you see the store page and decide not to even try out the free version I bought the 'Simple Apocalypse' asset from the Unity store and while it does most of what I want it has some issues and bugs due to the way the animations and mecanim are setup. amp#x200B; The character model cannot aim with any weapon hold type (besides pistol and that's likely because the idle pistol hold is the same as the aim), what this means is for any weapon type there's an animation for (such as RPG) the character always holds it in idle even when mecanim is set to use the shoot. そこで、プラットフォームに依存しないアプリを制作するための手法として、最近注目を浴びているのがCordovaです。. </p>
